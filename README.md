[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OpenSourceBrain/PospischilEtAl2008.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OpenSourceBrain/PospischilEtAl2008)

#### Overview of the Model

[Pospischil et. al. 2008](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00422-008-0263-8) describes conductance-based ([Hodgin-Huxley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin%E2%80%93Huxley_model)) models of four different classes of [cortical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex) and [thalamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalamus) neurons. The classes represented are:

- Regular Spiking (RS) cells
- Fast Spiking (FS) cells
- Intrinsicly Bursting (IB)
- Low-Threshold Spike (LTS) cells

All cell models are composed of [ion channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel) models generating the following currents:

- I<sub>Na</sub> Voltage dependent Na<sup>+</sup> current for depolarization phase of action potentials (APs)
- I<sub>Kd</sub> Delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup> current for hyperpolarization phase of APs
- I<sub>M</sub> Slow non-inactivating K<sup>+</sup> current for spike-frequency adaptation
- I<sub>L</sub> High-threshold Ca<sup>2+</sup> current for burst generation
- I<sub>T</sub> Low-threshold Ca<sup>2+</sup> current for rebound-burst generation

Leak and input current models are present in all cells as well.

These models demonstrate that a wide variety of spiking behaviors can be implemented using just a few types of ion channels.

#### Demonstrated Physiological Properties

Specifically, these models demonstrate the following properties:

**Regular Spiking**
The use of I<sub>Na</sub> and I<sub>Kd</sub> currents and applying a constant input current is sufficient to generate a train of spikes with constant frequency.

**Frequency Adaptation**
In addition to I<sub>Na</sub> and I<sub>Kd</sub> currents, including the I<sub>M</sub> current will result in a train of spikes where the inter-spike interval increases (and frequency decreases) with each spike in the train.

**Intrinsic Bursting**

When a calcium-dependent I<sub>L</sub> current is added to a cell with I<sub>Na</sub>, I<sub>Kd</sub>, and I<sub>M</sub> currents, the cell membrane potential will display an initial high-frequency burst of spikes and then settle onto a regular, frequency-adapting spiking behavior. The I<sub>L</sub> current makes use of variable Ca<sup>2+</sup> reversal potential which is computed from the [Nernst equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nernst_equation) by tracking changes in the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration.

**Rebound Bursting**

Similarly, using the calcium-dependent I<sub>T</sub> current instead of I<sub>L</sub> results in a cell that will fire a series of high-frequency spikes after a negative (hyperpolarizing) current is withdrawn from cell.

### Model Versions

The original version of this model as uploaded to ModelDB can be found in directory [NEURON_ORIG](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/PospischilEtAl2008/tree/master/NEURON_ORIG). 
An updated version of these scripts (in directory [NEURON_MODIFIED](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/PospischilEtAl2008/tree/master/NEURON_MODIFIED); 
[differences](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/PospischilEtAl2008/blob/master/NEURON_MODIFIED/diffs_to_original.txt)) has been used for the conversion to NeuroML 2.

A [neuroConstruct](http://www.neuroconstruct.org/) project [is included](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/PospischilEtAl2008/tree/master/neuroConstruct) which uses some of the ion channels to create cell models, but the 
[NeuroML2 version](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/PospischilEtAl2008/tree/master/NeuroML2) of the model is much more complete.

#### Why Convert to NeuroML?

The original models were implemented for the [NEURON simulator](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/). We have converted the model to NeuroML. The modular, XML nature of NeuroML allows to quickly re-use this model in network simulations and our tools allow [automated conversion to other supported simulator formats](https://neuroml.org/mappings).

#### NeuroML Version

All five cells have been implemented in NeuroML and match the output produced by the cells provided in the [original NEURON code](http://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel.cshtml?model=123623).

#### XPP Version

The Regular Spiking (RS) cell was also implemented in [XPP simulator](http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html) to enable rapid debugging of parameter and other issues with the original models.


### Installation Instructions

1. [Download the Model Files](archive/master.zip), or clone the repository using git: `git clone https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/PospischilEtAl2008.git`
2. [Follow instructions to Install jNeuroML](https://github.com/NeuroML/jNeuroML) for the **jnml** executable. On Windows, you may also need [SVN](https://subversion.apache.org/packages.html#windows). Alternatively install [PyNeuroML](https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML) for the **pynml** executable. 
3. Set the $PATH and $JNML_HOME variables as described in [#2](https://github.com/NeuroML/jNeuroML)
4. Extract the model files to a folder.
5. For Figure 1: Change to NeuroML2/Figure1 folder. Type `jnml LEMS_Figure1C.xml` or `pynml LEMS_Figure1C.xml`.
6. For RS (and other cells): Change to NeuroML2/cells/RS (or other) folder. Type `jnml LEMS_RS.xml` or `pynml LEMS_RS.xml`. 
7. Windows with the plotted figures should show up as can be seen above.
