### Minimal Hodgkin-Huxley type models for different classes of cortical and thalamic neurons

[![Continuous build using OMV](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/PospischilEtAl2008/actions/workflows/omv-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/PospischilEtAl2008/actions/workflows/omv-ci.yml)

Conversion to NeuroML of cell models from: [Minimal Hodgkin-Huxley type models for different classes of cortical and thalamic neurons](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00422-008-0263-8), Martin Pospischil, Maria Toledo-Rodriguez, Cyril Monier, Zuzanna Piwkowska, Thierry Bal, Yves Frégnac, Henry Markram and Alain Destexhe, Biological Cybernetics, 2008.

The original version of this model as uploaded to ModelDB can be found in directory [NEURON_ORIG](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/PospischilEtAl2008/tree/master/NEURON_ORIG). 
An updated version of these scripts (in directory [NEURON_MODIFIED](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/PospischilEtAl2008/tree/master/NEURON_MODIFIED); 
[differences](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/PospischilEtAl2008/blob/master/NEURON_MODIFIED/diffs_to_original.txt)) has been used for the conversion to NeuroML 2.

A [neuroConstruct](http://www.neuroconstruct.org/) project [is included](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/PospischilEtAl2008/tree/master/neuroConstruct) which uses some of the ion channels to create cell models, but the 
[NeuroML2 version](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/PospischilEtAl2008/tree/master/NeuroML2) of the model is much more complete.
