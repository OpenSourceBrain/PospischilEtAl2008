### Minimal Hodgkin-Huxley type models for different classes of cortical and thalamic neurons

Conversion to NeuroML of cell models from: [Minimal Hodgkin-Huxley type models for different classes of cortical and thalamic neurons](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00422-008-0263-8), Martin Pospischil, Maria Toledo-Rodriguez, Cyril Monier, Zuzanna Piwkowska, Thierry Bal, Yves Fr√©gnac, Henry Markram and Alain Destexhe, Biological Cybernetics, 2008.

The original version of this model as uploaded to ModelDB can be found in directory [NEURON_ORIG](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/PospischilEtAl2008/tree/master/NEURON_ORIG). 
An updated version of these scripts (in directory [NEURON_MODIFIED](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/PospischilEtAl2008/tree/master/NEURON_MODIFIED); 
[differences](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/PospischilEtAl2008/blob/master/NEURON_MODIFIED/diffs_to_original.txt)) has been used for the conversion to NeuroML 2.

A [neuroConstruct](http://www.neuroconstruct.org/) project [is included](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/PospischilEtAl2008/tree/master/neuroConstruct) which uses some of the ion channels to create cell models, but the 
[NeuroML2 version](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/PospischilEtAl2008/tree/master/NeuroML2) of the model is much more complete.
